# 5. System Architecture & Components

## High-Level Architecture
- master: Orchestrates the workflow, manages integration and data flow between components.
- license_llm: Extracts structured data from images using LLM, provides mapping logic for web forms.
- webbot: Handles web page download, form field interaction, and browser automation.
- memory: Stores HTML, mapping, and extracted data in a decoupled interface.

## Component Responsibilities
- master.py: Integration, workflow, and test runner.
- license_llm/pageread_llm.py: LLM-based HTML-to-data mapping.
- webbot/test_webbot_html_mapping.py: Web page download and test.
- memory/db.py: Data storage and retrieval.

## Decoupling
- Each component is independently testable and replaceable.
- Data is exchanged via well-defined interfaces and JSON.
