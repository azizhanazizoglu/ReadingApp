# 1. Project Overview

ReadingApp is a modular Python application for extracting, mapping, and filling web forms using LLMs. The system is designed to:
- Extract structured data from documents (e.g., Turkish ruhsat/vehicle registration) using LLMs.
- Analyze web page HTML and dynamically map data fields to form inputs.
- Automate web form filling and submission with minimal maintenance, even if the web page changes.
- Support decoupled, testable, and maintainable software components.
