# 2. V-Model & Development Methodology

## V-Model
- Requirements Analysis: User needs, regulatory, and technical requirements are gathered and documented.
- System Design: High-level architecture, component boundaries, and data flows are defined.
- Implementation: Each component is developed and unit tested independently.
- Integration: Components are integrated and tested as a system.
- Verification & Validation: System is validated against requirements and user stories.

## Professional Practices
- Modular, decoupled architecture
- Automated and manual testing (unit, integration, coverage)
- Version control (Git)
- Documentation and code review
