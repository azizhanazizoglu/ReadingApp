# 8. Test Strategy

- Unit tests for each component (webbot, license_llm, memory)
- Integration test via master.py (end-to-end data flow)
- Test coverage measurement (pytest --cov)
- Test data: sample ruhsat images, sample HTML pages
- Validation: mapping JSON correctness, data integrity in memory/db, webbot action simulation
