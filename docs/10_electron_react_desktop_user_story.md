# Electron + React Desktop User Story

As a desktop user, I run the Electron app to access the same React UI, triggering Ts1/Ts2 and reviewing logs without a browser. The backend remains the same Flask service.

- Start Electron (`electron_app/start_all.ps1` can orchestrate backend + UI)
- Use Developer Mode for quick flows
