# V-Model and Methodology

We follow a pragmatic V-Model-inspired workflow:

- Requirements captured in Markdown (docs folder), with unique IDs where needed.
- Architecture and components documented, with clear module boundaries and APIs.
- Implementation uses small, testable units and integration tests.
- Verification includes unit tests, integration tests, and structured logs.
- Traceability maps requirements ↔ tests ↔ code (see `traceability_matrix.md`).

## Practices
- Consistent coding style and modular structure
- Automated builds for React and Python linting/tests
- Unified logging format for backend and frontend developer logs
- Reproducible temp folder structure for artifacts
